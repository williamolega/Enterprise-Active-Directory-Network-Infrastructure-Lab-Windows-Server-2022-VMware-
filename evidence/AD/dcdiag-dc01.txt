            Event String:
            The security of this directory server can be significantly enhanced by configuring the server to reject SASL (Negotiate, Kerberos, NTLM, or Digest) LDAP binds that do not request signing (integrity verification) and LDAP simple binds that are performed on a clear text (non-SSL/TLS-encrypted) connection.  Even if no clients are using such binds, configuring the server to reject them will improve the security of this server.

            Event String:
            The security of this directory server can be significantly enhanced by configuring the server to enforce  validation of Channel Binding Tokens received in LDAP bind requests sent over LDAPS connections. Even if  no clients are issuing LDAP bind requests over LDAPS, configuring the server to validate Channel Binding  Tokens will improve the security of this server.
